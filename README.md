# Peach Farm Minecraft Mod

This mod adds a new crop to Minecraft, the peach tree. The peach tree is a small tree that grows peaches. 

The peaches can be eaten to gain hunger points. They can also be combined with other ingredients to craft food items such as Peach Cobbler, Peach Pie, and Peach Juice.

A new wood set is introduced to the game with the Peach Tree.

The peach tree can be grown from a peach sapling, which can be obtained from a peach tree found in plains biomes.
